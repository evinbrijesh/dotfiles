# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal system configuration files, including Zsh, Neovim, and related setup folders, used to customize and maintain a consistent development environment across machines. These files are intended for personal reference, backup, and quick re-setup, but may also be useful as a starting point for others configuring similar workflows.
